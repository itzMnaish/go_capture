            <h2> 1 . Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                How do businesses identify potential customers and expand across new and diverse consumer groups? How do
                they ensure that exposure through advertising crystallizes into involved perception and action on the
                part of the audience?


            </p>
            <p>
                This process of due identification and attraction of prospective customers by synthesizing their
                interest in and engagement with a brand and its products or services is filed under lead generation.
                From grabbing attention to creating pathways of connection that would convert these collected ‘leads’
                into buyers, it is an indispensable part of the sales and marketing funnel, and has only grown in
                significance with the revolutionizing way of shopping brand identity and conducting business.


            </p>
            <p>
                As the market gets saturated with offerings, it becomes essential to distinguish oneself by curating the
                whole experience of consumers instead of focusing on just one-time sales. It is in this arena that
                gamification of lead collection has emerged as a distinct possibility of fostering meaningful
                relationships and reshaping one’s brand identity through it.

                experimented with for scoring leads and driving conversion rates. The following are the key components
                of collecting leads across an array of channels:

                strategy and also the basis of diversification. Identify the problems of these potential customers you
                are hoping to solve.

                Content marketing in the form of case studies, blogs, infographics, ebooks, crash courses and other free
                resources have traditionally been used to draw in varied audiences by cultivating their interests. Most
                of these can be predicated by a distinct call to action that compels the visitors to offer their contact
                details in return for valuable information.

                Every social media platform has its own preference for a particular type of content that its users
                resonate the best with. Aligning yourself with those trends and following up with targeted ads and
