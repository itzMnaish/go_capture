            <h2> 1 . Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Photobooths have become a regular feature at events, both social and corporate. Amid such extensive
                usage and popularity, how do we ensure that they retain an element of novelty that can wow an onlooker
                upon first glance? How does an event organizer see to it that event photography isn’t merely ancillary
                to the occasion with the booth as an accessory, but is essential to the objective fulfillment of the
                event?

                is a rising star on the shore of event technology. The booth has found a wide variety of uses, from
                dynamic backdrop changes to interactive elements that transport its users into an altogether different
                environment. Such innovative AR setups are revolutionizing the way we capture memories and interact with
                attendees, particularly apt for corporate gatherings.

            <h2> 2 . Augmented Reality: the gift that keeps on giving
            </h2>
            <p>
                Augmented reality is a technology that mitigates our real-world interactions, which is to say, it is
                rooted in our immediate surroundings. By superimposing three-dimensional graphics, audio and text onto
                the real world, AR can extend the physical environment and charge it with new meaning and dimensions.
                Such a medium presents infinite possibilities in conceptualiing, designing and executing events, as
                listed below:

            </p>
            <li>
                <b>
                    As an event planning and visualization tool :
                </b>
                With the ability to create life-size, 3D models, AR lends itself to planning and conceptualization. From
                delineating an intricate venue layout and elaborate set designs to introducing new ideas and design and
                technology concepts at conferences and exhibitions, augmented reality is an amazing tool to sketch out
                one’s mind. This is a fruitful means of minimizing chances of substantial unguided investment of
                capital, time and energy.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Dynamic information exchange and learning :
                </b>
                Following from the aforementioned point, it may be extended that AR can excellently level up the way we
                share information and communicate. It is a powerful storytelling medium that contributes to immersive
                learning for participants, also granting them a personalized nd more controlled experience of the data
                they encounter. This isn’t simply to say that your presentation will be cooler than the rest. The right
                use of AR can foster audience engagement in a more emotive manner- seeing is believing after all! Thus,
                AR is an adept campaigning tool, motivating involvemnet and action among the viewers.

                    Easing navigation and accessibility :
                </b>
                Augmented reality can be utilised to create interactive maps that not only provide guidance regarding
                physical pathways, but can also help people connect, find each other, discover sessions happening at
                different time and booth slots, and more. Additionally, devices such as the Google lens are rendering
                events more open in real-time, democratising information exchange and championing inclusivity by
                providing subtitles and translations. Dr. Helen Papagiannis highlights in such instances the
                human-centered nature of design and technological innovation, which inspires creativity.

                3 . What is an Augmented Reality Photo Booth?
            </h2>
            <p>
                An Augmented Reality Photo Booth is an interactive imaging system that integrates real-world
                environments with computer-generated enhancements, creating a composite view that is enriched with
                virtual elements. Unlike traditional photo booths that can mostly capture static images, an AR Photo
                Booth employs advanced computer vision and graphics technology to overlay dynamic, virtual content onto
                the captured scene in real-time. <br>

                ">
                <br>

                It is also equipped with sensors to track the users’ location and motion to perceive the environment and
                superimpose virtual props, backgrounds, filters, animation and other special effects over the live feed.
                User engagement is secured with the AR Photo Booth by interacting with these virtual augmentations,
                enhancing the people’s visual appearance or introducing imaginative and entertaining components into
                their photos or videos. Here are the four essential ways in which an AR Booth enriches the event
                experience and makes the photobooth an immersive space:
            </p>
            <li><b>Personalised for each user: </b>
                By providing a host of digital elements for the attendees to interact with, the output generated is also
                different each time, giving the users great freedom of choice and direction.
            </li>
            <li><b>Dynamic brand activations:</b>
                Instead of belatedly posting the brand logo over captured photos, the AR Booth invokes the brand’s
                identity in its very function through dynamic elements placed for optimum visibility.

            </li>
            <li><b>A uniquely sharable experience:</b>
                These unique photographs thus generated speak of an incredible moment that prompts people to document
                the memory on social media, doubling user-gerenrated content and bringing in online traction for the
                event.

            </li>
            <li><b>Purposive entertainment: </b>
                An AR Booth can be designed with edutainment principles in mind, fostering learning, endearing the users
                towards the brand and creating an immersive, cheerful environment overall.

            </h2>
            <li><b>AR Runway Booth for Mercedes Benz Fashion Week:</b>
                Everybody wants to look good and bask in the limelight. But the high fashion runway remains a space
                guarded by strict rules of the industry. At the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week, the organizers broke free
                from these constraints to allow any of the attendees to walk the talk and own the moment. A virtual
                runway was created with the instlltion of an AR Booth, at which the visitors could stop for a customised
                souvenir. This <a

                    AR runway </a>
                gave a chance to anyone who desired to pose and do a mini catwalk, out of which boomerangs were created
                to be shared on Instagram. More than thousand people stopped by the booth to recreate a magical moment
                for themselves, and were featured on the organiser’s social media channels.

                    a Coke campaign </a> quickly became a masterclass in marketing and quite the global phenomenon. This
                campaign leveraged personalization with a touch of emotional appeal, both of which facilitated the third
                factor of social sharing. Noting a 7% increase in consumption among its target audience (millenials)
                within a year, another fun element of the strategy was the hosting of AR Photo Booths at in-person
                events across cities. They allowed people to virtually customize their own bottle of this beloved
                beverage, signing off with their names and taking pictures with them.

                AR-powered product trials are also a popular feature at product launches and trade fairs. IKEA had also
                launched its IKEA Place app for Apple users, the in-person experience of which it provided at pop-up and
                store-held events hosted across the globe. Visitors could try out products from their latest collections
