    In proportion to its presence and industrial leadership acumen, the annual Company Day celebration also takes the form of a colossal festival, complete with thematic decorations, games, selfie booths and more.

  <p>
    We started off with the <a href="https://www.gokapture.com/digital-touch-games">digital touch games</a>, namely the <strong>Memory Game</strong> and the <strong>Jigsaw Puzzle</strong>. These two branded games are among our most in-demand interactive experiences for corporate events, owing to their versatility and adaptability. These digital game booths are </p>

    <p>incredibly user-friendly and attractive in their vibrant layout, perfect to keep diverse crowds of visitors occupied. The Memory Game is a customizable activity of collecting matching pairs of cards and is a brand-favourite when it comes to heightening brand visibility, specially in terms of a company’s core values, messages, products and services.

      <p>Another megahit was our IOT-powered <a href="https://www.gokapture.com/stepper-activity">Spot Running Activity</a>. Also known as the Stepper, it is a versatile interactive game setup that can be arranged for individual challenges or teamplaying. While the participants run on the designated spots, the connected display is powered to showcase customized animation and message. Thus, it can be used to design brand-specific missions or to give the runners the feel of an actual track race, as was the case for ADP.
